This is to create a VGA interface for EOMA68 Micro Engineering Board

The creative designs here are subject to copyright (C) J. Michael 2013,

The PCB has been done up for Seeed Studio manufacturing requirements.
There is also eoma_vga_panel.kicad_pcb which has 4 panelized copies inside
a 10cm x 10cm boundary to suit Seeed Studio manufacturing.

If you make a board I'm happy to put put it up as an example board that
others have made.
